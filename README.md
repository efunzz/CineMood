## API Integration

Two APIs are used in this project:

1. **OMDb API**: Fetches movie details such as title, plot, and IMDb ID.
2. **TMDb API**: Fetches movie trailers by utilizing the IMDb ID obtained from the OMDb API.

## Movie Selection

The movies used in this project were selected based on personal opinion and are intended as placeholders to demonstrate the website's functionality.

## Usage

1. Select a mood, and the app will fetch movies that match the mood from the OMDb API.
2. Movie details such as the title, plot, and poster will be displayed.
3. A YouTube trailer link will be provided for movies that have a trailer available.

## Future Improvements

- **Animations**: Implement Framer Motion for smoother transitions and interactive elements.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Apply Tailwind CSS for faster, more flexible styling in future versions.
- **Enhanced movie search**: Add more advanced filtering options, such as genre or release year filters.

## Acknowledgements
